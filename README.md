Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Victor Adesoye Oluwaferanmi.

I'm a **student [ programmer | graphics designer | video editor ]** focused on crafting clean & userâ€‘friendly experiences, I am passionate about building excellent softwares that would be of great help to humanity. I don't like to define myself by the work I've done, I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and doing intresting things that matters. I am known for my passion for building great products, ability to learn quickly, being a good team player and excellent listener.

I have excellent skills, and I am also intrested in learning new skills. I also hope to study Robotics & AI (Artificial Intelligence) and CyberSecurity during my Master's degree when done in college, cause learning brings growth, and when I learn I grow, and I get to reach my goal and achieve clients satisfaction. I've got everything you need to launch and grow your business. Trust me.
